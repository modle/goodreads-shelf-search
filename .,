If you're looking for a reason to write or feel your writing is inadequate, she's got you covered.<br/><br/>Some memorable quotes:<br/><br/>“You don’t care about those first three pages; those you will throw out, those you needed to write to get to that fourth page, to get to that one long paragraph that was what you had in mind when you started, only you didn’t know that, couldn’t know that, until you got to it.”<br/><br/>“Writing is, for some of us, the latch that keeps the door of the pen closed, keeps those crazy ravenous dogs contained.”<br/><br/>“The unconscious mind is the cellar where a little boy sits who creates your characters, and he hands them up to you through the cellar door. He might as well be cutting out paper dolls. He’s peaceful; he’s just playing. You can’t will yourself into being receptive to what the little boy has to offer, and you can’t buy a key that will let you into the cellar.”<br/><br/>“If you find that you start a number of stories or pieces that you don’t ever bother finishing, that you lose interest or faith in them along the way, it may be that there is nothing at their center about which you care passionately.”<br/><br/>“Take the attitude that what you are thinking and feeling is valuable stuff, and then be naive enough to get it all down on paper.”<br/><br/>“Breaking through the writer’s block is like catching amoebic dysentery. You’ll just be sitting there minding your own business, and the next minute you’ll rush to your desk with an urgency you had not believed possible.”<br/><br/>“When people shine a little light on their monster, we find out how similar most of our monsters are.”<br/><br/>“Find your room or closet or wood or cave or abyss that you were told not to go into. Go in and look around for a long while, just breathing and taking it all in. Then you will be able to speak in your own voice and stay in the present moment. And that moment is home.”<br/><br/>“Writing is like building sand castles out of words. We believe, deep in our hearts, that if we build our castles well enough, somehow the ocean won’t wash them away. I think this is a wonderful kind of person to be.”<br/><br/>“So why does our writing matter? Because of the spirit. Because of the heart. Writing and reading decrease our sense of isolation. They deepen and widen and expand our sense of life: they feed the soul.”<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,
